# Excel_Sales_Dashboard

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used to build a visually engaging, interactive, and insight-driven dashboard for business performance analysis.

The dashboard is designed as a two-page report, combining executive-level KPIs with deeper analytical views to support data-driven decision-making.
